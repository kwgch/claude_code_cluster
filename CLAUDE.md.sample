# Claude Code Parallel Execution Project

## Project Essence

This project is a framework that enables **Claude Code to dynamically spawn as many subprocesses as needed, launching multiple Claude Code instances to work in parallel and maximize efficiency**.

### Core Value Proposition

1. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically launches the optimal number of Claude Code instances based on task complexity and system resources
2. **True Parallel Processing**: Each instance works independently while coordinating through file-based communication
3. **Efficiency Maximization**: Transitions from traditional sequential processing to parallel processing, dramatically reducing completion time for complex projects

## Technical Implementation

### Solving TTY Limitations
- **Problem**: Claude CLI requires an interactive terminal (TTY) and doesn't work in standard background processes
- **Solution**: Using `node-pty` library to provide pseudo-terminal environment

### Parallel Execution Mechanism
```javascript
// Launch Claude CLI with PTY environment for each worker
const ptyProcess = pty.spawn('claude', [instructions], {
    name: 'xterm-color',
    env: { TERM: 'xterm-256color' }
});
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Large-Scale Development Projects
```bash
# Building a full-stack application with 6 workers
Worker 1: Backend API development
Worker 2: Frontend UI implementation
Worker 3: Authentication system
Worker 4: Real-time features
Worker 5: Test suite creation
Worker 6: Dockerization and documentation
```

### 2. Research & Analysis Tasks
```bash
# Parallel investigation with 4 workers
Worker 1: Technical research and prototyping
Worker 2: Competitive analysis and benchmarking
Worker 3: Security evaluation
Worker 4: Performance optimization
```

### 3. Content Generation
```bash
# Large-scale documentation with multiple workers
Worker 1: API reference generation
Worker 2: Tutorial creation
Worker 3: Sample code development
Worker 4: Integration and review
```

## Execution Method

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Setup
./setup_node_runner.sh

# Parallel execution
node parallel_claude_runner.js worker1_instructions.md worker2_instructions.md ...
```

### Task Definition
1. Define main task in `task.md`
2. System automatically determines worker count
3. Generate appropriate instructions for each worker
4. Execute in parallel with monitoring

## Monitoring and Communication

### Real-time Monitoring
- Process state visualization
- Progress tracking for each worker
- Error detection and handling

### Inter-worker Communication
```bash
# Status update
echo "[Worker1] Status: API implementation complete" >> comm/worker1_status.txt

# Completion notification
echo "[Worker1] COMPLETED: Backend API ready" >> comm/worker1_status.txt
```

## Expected Benefits

### Development Speed Improvement
- **Traditional**: Single Claude Code processes tasks sequentially
- **Parallelized**: N Claude Code instances develop different parts simultaneously

### Quality Enhancement
- Each worker focuses on specialized areas
- Parallel review and testing
- Integrated quality assurance

### Scalability
- Dynamically adjust worker count based on task scale
- Optimal utilization of system resources
- Future potential for distributed execution in cloud environments

## Future Prospects

1. **Claude API Integration**: Parallel execution via API in addition to CLI
2. **Distributed Execution**: Worker distribution across multiple machines
3. **Auto-optimization**: Automatic task splitting and assignment
4. **Visualization Dashboard**: Progress management through Web UI

## Usage Notes

- Each worker operates as an independent Claude Code instance
- Workers operate in different directories to avoid file conflicts
- Monitor resource usage (approximately 2GB memory per worker)
